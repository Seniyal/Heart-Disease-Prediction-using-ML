### Heart Disease Prediction using ML

Preventing heart disease has become a critical priority, as it plays a key role in improving public health outcomes. Leveraging data-driven systems for heart disease prediction can revolutionize research and prevention efforts, enabling healthier lives for many. This is where Machine Learning proves invaluable, offering highly accurate predictions for heart disease detection.

In this project, heart disease patient data was analyzed and preprocessed thoroughly. Multiple Machine Learning models were then trained, with predictions generated using algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and others. This work was presented as part of a Kaggle kernel titled **"Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras"**, featuring both the dataset and Jupyter Notebook code.

The project employed several Machine Learning techniques in Python to tackle this binary classification problem. Input features included a range of health parameters, while the target variable was binary, indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

### Machine Learning Algorithms Used:
1. **Logistic Regression** (Scikit-learn)
2. **Naive Bayes** (Scikit-learn)
3. **Support Vector Machine (Linear)** (Scikit-learn)
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** (Scikit-learn)
5. **Decision Tree** (Scikit-learn)
6. **Random Forest** (Scikit-learn)
7. **XGBoost** (Scikit-learn)
8. **Artificial Neural Network** with 1 hidden layer (Keras)

### Results:
The Random Forest algorithm achieved the highest accuracy of **95%**.
